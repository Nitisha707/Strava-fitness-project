# Strava-fitness-project
Strava fitness project for data analysis.


Introduction
This report presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Strava fitness data. The dataset contains details of multiple running sessions, including distance, time, pace, speed, elevation, and social engagement. The goal of this project is to identify training trends, performance patterns, and correlations among key metrics.

1. Distance Over Time
The distance covered shows consistent training patterns with gradual improvement. Longer runs are mostly recorded during weekends, while weekdays feature shorter runs.

2. Pace Distribution
The pace distribution indicates most runs fall within a consistent range, suggesting moderate running intensity. Occasional faster paces indicate interval or tempo workouts.

3. Activity by Weekday
Analysis by weekday shows higher average distances on weekends compared to weekdays. This suggests long runs are scheduled during weekends, while weekdays are reserved for recovery runs.

4. Speed vs Distance
There is an inverse relationship between distance and speed. Shorter runs tend to have higher average speeds, while longer runs are slower, reflecting endurance training patterns.

5. Correlation Heatmap
Correlation analysis reveals strong relationships between distance, moving time, and pace. Average speed and pace show an expected inverse correlation.

Conclusion
The Strava fitness analysis highlighted training habits and performance trends. Findings showed a balanced approach with long weekend runs and shorter weekday recovery sessions. These insights can guide training optimization, track progress, and improve performance over time.
